While Geyser aims to support all Java program versions, not every version will fully support Geyser.

### Java 16

Java 16 currently does not support encrypting Bedrock client connections - any information from Geyser to the client can theoretically be seen by others! This will be fixed before Minecraft 1.17.

### Older Java 8 versions

Older Java 8 versions do not properly support the type of encryption Bedrock requires, including the one bundled in with Minecraft: Java Edition by default. Update your Java version if you're unsure.
