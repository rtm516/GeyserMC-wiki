Bedrock clients will join through Geyser and it will handle all the packet translations. There are four different versions of Geyser: Geyser for Bukkit (works on derivatives such as Spigot and Paper), Geyser for BungeeCord (also works on Waterfall), Geyser for Velocity, and Geyser Standalone. The first three versions run as plugins, and can be installed directly onto the server. The standalone version can be used in a similar way, except you run it separately. 

If you are running a server, it is highly recommended you use one of the plugin versions, and if you want to join a server that does not have Geyser installed, you can run the standalone version.
