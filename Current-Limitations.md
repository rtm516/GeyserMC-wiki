With Geyser being a protocol translator between two different games with two different codebases, there are a handful of limitations that Geyser is unfortunately unable to handle. Despite Minecraft Bedrock and Java being quite close in comparison, there are some vast differences in many areas.

The following things cannot be fixed without changes to Bedrock or the Java protocol in general. As of now, they are not fixable in Geyser.

- Custom heads in inventories
- Clickable links in chat
- Glowing effect
- Crafting in the 2x2 menu while in creative mode
- Distinguishing between left and right clicks in containers
- Redstone dot blockstates

The following changes **are supported** with the [GeyserOptionalPack](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/wiki/GeyserOptionalPack), which is a Bedrock resource pack you can install for additional functionality for features Bedrock does not natively support:
- Custom armor stand poses
- Illusioners
- Iron golem cracked texture
- Hit particles and other miscellaneous particles not natively in Bedrock
- Offhand animations
- Shulker invisibility
- Spectral arrow texture
