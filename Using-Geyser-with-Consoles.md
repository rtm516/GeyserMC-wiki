All consoles can join third-party servers - including Geyser servers - with workarounds. Xbox One and Nintendo Switch systems can join third-party servers using a third-party program called BedrockConnect. For technical information about the program, including how to run your own setup, see [their GitHub repository](https://github.com/Pugmatt/BedrockConnect) (*This program is not affiliated with GeyserMC*). On PS4, other methods are available for use.

# PlayStation 4

Unfortunately at this time, PS4 does not have any external server support. However, there are ways around this by emulating a LAN game on your network.
