1. Download a jar of Geyser from the [build server](https://ci.nukkitx.com/job/Geyser/job/master/) depending on what platform your server runs on.
2. Put Geyser in your plugins folder and start up the server.
3. Configure any needed options in the Geyser config. In most scenarios this file should not need to be touched unless you intend to use [Floodgate](Floodgate), or you're running your Java on a port that is not 25565.
4. Restart your server if needed.

Once you're done, open up Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and in the **Friends** tab, Geyser should show up there. If it does not show up, just add your IPv4 as an external server. 

If you're still having problems with Geyser not working or giving you an "Unable to connect to world" error, see the [Common Issues](Common-Issues) page.

For more information, take a look at the [Understanding the Config](Understanding-the-Config) page, and the [How Geyser Works](https://geysermc.org/#howitworks) page.
