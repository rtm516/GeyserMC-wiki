GeyserOptionalPack is a resource pack that adds more features to Geyser to bring Bedrock Edition in line with Java Edition. A resource pack allows various features and bug fixes to be implemented in Bedrock, including:

- Armor stand poses and arm/baseplate visibility
- Illusioner texture
- Iron golem cracked texture
- Missing particles, like sweep attack
- Spectral arrow entity texture

A more complete list can be found on the optional pack's [README](https://github.com/GeyserMC/GeyserOptionalPack/blob/master/README.md). 

It is not required to install the resource pack yourself - clients can install it themselves. Additionally, if you use a proxy like WaterdogPE, you can install the pack on the server without impacting gameplay on other Bedrock servers.
