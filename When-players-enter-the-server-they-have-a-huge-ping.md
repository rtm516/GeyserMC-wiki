When players enter the server they have a huge ping, it happens that it is even difficult for someone to log in, and if a player with a large ping comes in, this message spam in the chat, I assume because of this:
[13:34:59] [Netty Epoll Server IO #0/WARN]: io.netty.channel.unix.Errors$NativeIoException: syscall:writev(..) failed: Broken pipe
[13:34:59] [Netty Epoll Server IO #0/WARN]: 	at io.netty.channel.unix.FileDescriptor.writeAddresses(..)(Unknown Source)
