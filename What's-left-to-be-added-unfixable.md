###Geyser has many features, but we aren't perfect yet. Here are some things that Geyser has yet to add. (Feel free to try to work on these yourself!)


## What's Left to be Added/Fixed
- Lecterns
- Near-perfect movement (to the point where anticheat on large servers is unlikely to ban you)
- Resource pack conversion/CustomModelData
- Some Entity Flags
- The Following Inventories (To be fixed in the upcoming inventory rewrite)
  - Enchantment Table (as a proper GUI)
  - Beacon
  - Cartography Table
  - Stonecutter
  - Structure Block
  - Horse Inventory
  - Loom
  - Smithing Table

## What can't be fixed
The following things can't be fixed because of Bedrock limitations. They might be fixable in the future, but not as of now.

- Custom heads in inventories
- Clickable links in chat
- Glowing effect
