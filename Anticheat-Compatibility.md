- [Example anticheat](https://geysermc.org) - this works great, or it doesn't, I don't know. It doesn't work well because [players lag back, reach detection stinks, players are always flying]
- [NoCheatPlus](https://github.com/Updated-NoCheatPlus/NoCheatPlus) - Not compatible. Players constantly lag back, or get stuck in blocks.
