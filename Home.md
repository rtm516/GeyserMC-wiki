_A bridge between Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition._

**Currently supporting Minecraft Bedrock v1.16.x and Minecraft Java v1.16.4 :)**

The goal of Geyser is to bridge the Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition by allowing Bedrock clients to join Java Edition servers. This project is still in development and not complete yet, so expect bugs.
